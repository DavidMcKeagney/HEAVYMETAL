looking at the 5p-4f transitions in gold 

first start with Au2+
calculate discrete state spectrum then include the continuum states included in the paper
try convolve the lines with a guassian of FWHM of 0.05 ev so that you can produce a theoretical spectra 

need to look more at continuum states and see what they do and how they are treated 

Then once confortable with this try Au3+ and Au4+
